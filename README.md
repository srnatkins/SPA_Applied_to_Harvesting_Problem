# SPA_Applied_to_Harvesting_Problem
The matlab files here incorporate a switch point algorithm to numerically solve a harvesting optimal control problem. 


In order to run most of these files (except for the plotting files) one will need to download the SuiteOPT software.
This software can be accessed on https://people.clas.ufl.edu/hager/software/ 
This software works for linux and unix systems. 
In our experiments we used the SuiteOPT version 2.0.3. You can use the 
same link but click software archive to access this older version of the software.
